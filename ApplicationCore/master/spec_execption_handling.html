Introduction</h1>
<p>Exceptions are handled by ApplicationCore in a way that the application developer does not need to care much about it.</p>
<p>ChimeraTK::runtime_error exceptions are caught by the framework and are reported to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>. The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> handles this exception and periodically tries to open the device. Communication with the faulty device is frozen or delayed until the device is functional again. In case of several devices only the faulty device is frozen. Faulty devices do not prevent the application from starting, only the parts of the application that depend on the fault device are waiting for the device to come up.</p>
<p>Input variables of ApplicationModules which cannot be read due to a faulty device will set and propagate the DataValidity::faulty flag (see also <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>).</p>
<p>When the device is functional, it be (re)initialised by using application-defined initialisation handlers and also recover the last known values of its process variables.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="spec_exceptionHandling_intro_terminology"></a>
Special terminology used in this document</h2>
<ul>
<li>An read operation might be "skipped". It means, the operation will not take place at all. Instead, the data is marked as DataValidity::faulty. Note: This term is also used, if the a running operation is interrupted by an exception.</li>
<li>An read operation might be "frozen". This means, the function called will not return until the fault state is resolved and the operation is executed. Freezing always happens before the actual operation is executed and hence will always act on pre-existing fault states only.</li>
<li>An write operation might be "delayed". This means, the operation will not be executed immediately and the calling thread continues. The operation will be asynchronosuly executed when the fault state is resolved. Note that the VersionNumber specified in the write operation will be retained and also used for the delayed write operation.</li>
<li>Whenever a write operation or a call to write() is mentioned, destructive writes via writeDestructively() are included. The destructive write optimisation makes no difference for the exception handling.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="spec_execptionHandling_behaviour"></a>
A. Behavioural description</h1>
<ul>
<li>1. All ChimeraTK::runtime_error exceptions thrown by device register accessors are handled by the framework and are never exposed to user code in ApplicationModules.<ul>
<li>1.1 ChimeraTK::logic_error exceptions are left unhandled and will terminate the application. These errors may only occur in the initialisation phase (up to the point where all devices are opened and initialised) and point to a severe configuration error which is not recoverable. (*)</li>
<li>1.2 Exception handling and DataValidity flag propagation is implemented such that it is transparent to a module whether it is directly connected to a device, or whether a fanout or another application module is in between.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2. When an exception has been received by the framework (thrown by a device register accessor):<ul>
<li>2.1 The exception status is published as a process variable together with an error message.<ul>
<li>2.1.1 The variable Devices/&lt;alias&gt;/status contains a boolean flag whether the device is in an error state</li>
<li>2.1.2 The variable Devices/&lt;alias&gt;/message contains an error message, if the device is in an error state, or an empty string otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.2 Read operations will propagate the DataValidity::faulty flag to the owning module / fan out (without changing the actual value):<ul>
<li>2.2.1 The normal module algorithm code will be continued, to allow this flag to propagate to the outputs in the same way as if it had been received through the process variable itself (c.f. 1.2).</li>
<li>2.2.2 The DataValidity::faulty flag resulting from the fault state is propagated once, even if the variable had the a DataValidity::faulty flag already set previously for another reason.</li>
<li>2.2.3 Read operations without AccessMode::wait_for_new_data are skipped.</li>
<li>2.2.4 Read operations with AccessMode::wait_for_new_data will be skipped once for each accessor to propagate the DataValidity::faulty flag (which counts as new data, i.e. readNonBlocking() will return true). In the following:<ul>
<li>non-blocking read operations (readNonBlocking() and readLatest()) are skipped and return false, until new data has arrived from the device, and</li>
<li>blocking read operations (read()) will freeze until new data has arrived from the device.</li>
<li>Note: The device may start sending data already before the recovery procedure (cf. 3.1) is complete. If this is not acceptable, a device specific handshake mechanism has to be implemented in the application to control when the device is allowed to send updates again. (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.2.5 If the fault state had been resolved in between two read operations (regardless of the type) and the device had become faulty again before the second read is executed, it is not defined whether the second operation will frozen/skipped (depending on the type) or not. The second operation might behave either like it is a new exception or like the same fault state would still prevail. (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.3 Write operations will be delayed. In case of a fault state (new or persisting), the actual write operation will take place asynchronously when the device is recovering. The same mechanism as used for 3.1.2 is used here, hence the order of write operations is guaranteed across accessors, but only the latest written value of each accessor prevails. (*)<ul>
<li>2.3.1 The return value of write() indicates whether data was lost in the transfer. If the write has to be delayed due to an exception, the return value will be true, if a previously delayed and not-yet written value is discarded in the process, false otherwise.</li>
<li>2.3.2 When the delayed value is finally written to the device during the recovery procedure, it is guaranteed that no data loss happens (writes with data loss will be retried).</li>
<li>2.3.3 It is guaranteed that the write takes place before the device is considered fully recovered again and other transfers are allowed (cf. 3.1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4 In case of exceptions, there is no guaranteed realtime behaviour, not even for "non-blocking" transfers. (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3. The framework tries to resolve an exception state by periodically re-opening the faulty device.<ul>
<li>3.1 After successfully re-opening the device, a recovery procedure is executed before allowing any read/write operations from the AppliactionModules and FanOuts again. This recovery procedure involves:<ul>
<li>3.1.1 the execution of so-called initialisation handlers (see 3.2), and</li>
<li>3.1.2 restoring all registers that have been written since the start of the application with their latest values. The register values are restored in the same order they were written. (*)</li>
<li>3.1.3 Finally, Devices/&lt;alias&gt;/deviceBecameFunctional is written to inform any module subscribing this variable about the finished recovery. (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3.2 Any number of initialisation handlers can be added to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> in the user code. Initialisation handlers are callback function which will be executed when a device is opened for the first time and after a device recovers from an exception, before any process variables are written. See <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#ab30bf1b235913143d45bb5da7d84052c" title="Add initialisation handlers to the device. ">DeviceModule::addInitialisationHandler()</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4. The behaviour at application start (when all devices are still closed at first) is similar to the case of a later received exception. The only differences are mentioned in 4.2.<ul>
<li>4.1 Even if some devices are initially in a persisting error state, the part of the application which does not interact with the faulty devices starts and works normally.</li>
<li>4.2 Initial values are correctly propagated after a device is opened. See <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>. Especially, all read operations (even readNonBlocking/readLatest) will be frozen until an initial value has been received. (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5. Any <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> can explicitly report a problem with the device by calling <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#a866cf974d4a178d389753536be5a88db" title="Use this function to report an exception. ">DeviceModule::reportException()</a>. This allows the reinitialisation of a device e.g. after a reboot of the device which didn't result in a exception (e.g. because it was too quick to be noticed, or rebooting the device takes place without interrupting the communication).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="spec_execptionHandling_behaviour_comments"></a>
(*) Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.1 In future, maybe logic_errors are also handled, so configuration errors can nicely be presented to the control system. This may be important especially since logic_errors may depend also on the configuration of external components (devices). If e.g. a device is changed (e.g. device is another control system application which has been modified), logic_errors may be thrown in the recovery phase, despite the device had been successfully initialsed previously.</li>
<li>2.2.4 Preventing the device to send data before the recovery is complete is not trivial in the general case for asynchronous transfers (i.e. wait_for_new_data). Race conditions might occur if the transport layer does not guarantee the order of packets (e.g. UDP), in which case unsubscribing a variable might not guarantee that no more data arrives which has been sent before unsubscribing. Hence it was decided not to specify a mechanism which would guarantee that no asychronous data transfers take place before the recovery has completed.</li>
<li>2.2.5 Not defining the behaviour here avoids a conflict with 1.2 without requiring a complicated implementation which does not block in this case. Implementing this would not present any gain for the application. If there are many exceptions on the same device in a short period of time, the number of faulty data updates seen by the application modules will always depend on the speed the module is attempting to read data (unless we require every exception to be visible to every module, but this will have complex effects, too). It might break consistency of the number of updates sent through different paths in an application, but applications should anyway not rely on that and use a DataConsistencyGroup to synchronise instead. Hence, the implementation will block always if a blocking read sees a known exception</li>
<li>2.3 / 3.1.3 If timing is important for write operations (e.g. must not write a sequence of registers too fast), or if multiple values need to be written to the same register in sequence, the application cannot fully rely on the framework's recovery procedure. The framework hence provides the process variable Devices/&lt;alias&gt;/deviceBecameFunctional for each device, which will be written each time the recovery procedure is completed (cf. 3.1.3). ApplicationModules which implement such timed sequence need to receive this variable and restart the entire sequence after the recovery.</li>
<li>2.4 Even non-blocking read and write operations are not truely non-blocking, since they are still synchronous. The "non-blocking" guarantee only means that the operation does not block until new data has arrived, and that it is not frozen until the device is recovered. For the duration of the recovery procedure and of course for timeout periods these operations may still block.</li>
<li>3.1.2 For some applications, the order of writes may be important, e.g. if firmware expects this. Please note that the VersionNumber is insufficient as a sorting criteria, since many writes may have been done with the same VersionNumber (in an <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a>, the VersionNumber used for the writes is determined by the largest VersionNumber of the inputs).</li>
<li>4.2 DataValidity::faulty is initially set by default, so there is no need to propagate this flag initially. To prevent race conditions and undefined behaviour, it even needs to be made sure that the flag is not propagated unnecessarily. The behaviour of non-blocking reads presents a slight asymmetry between the initial device opening and a later recovery. This will in particular be visible when restarting a server while a device is offline. If a module only uses readLatest()/readNonBlocking() (= read() for poll-type inputs) for the offline device, the module was still running before the server restart using the last known values for the dysfunctional registers (and flagging all outputs as faulty). After the restart, the module has to wait for the initial value and hence will not run until the device becomes functional again. To make this behaviour symmetric, one would need to persist the values of device inputs. Since this only affects a corner case in which anyway no usable output is produced, this slight inconsistency is considered acceptable.</li>

<li>4.2 Reason for not using an (exclusive) lock: Incrementing and decrementing the counter is done in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application.

<li>4.3.2 A shared lock (in contrast to an exclusive lock) is used for the same reasons as in 4.2.</li>
<li>4.5.1 This prevents a race condition in 2.3.15.

<li>4.5.2 This prevents data loss due to a race condition.

<li>1.1 Possible future change: Output accessors can have the option not to have a <a class="el" href="struct_chimera_t_k_1_1_recovery_helper.html" title="A Helper struct to store an accessor and a version number. ">RecoveryHelper</a>. This is needed for instance for "trigger registers" which start an operation on the hardware.

">RecoveryHelper</a> (once the void data type is supported by <a class="el" href="namespace_chimera_t_k.html" title="Generic modules for status monitoring. ">ChimeraTK</a>).</li>
<li>1.1.1 The written flag cannot be replaced by comparing RecoveryHelper::accessor.getCurrentVersion() and <a class="el" href="struct_chimera_t_k_1_1_recovery_helper.html#ac4c488a3aecf5f363b46f15c26b566ee">RecoveryHelper::versionNumber</a>, because normal writes (without exceptions) would not update the version number of the <a class="el" href="struct_chimera_t_k_1_1_recovery_helper.html#a1c13eb170308c756b559d46c35681d14">RecoveryHelper::accessor</a>. The written flag is atomic so it can be set without getting the recoveryLock again in doPostWrite(). This has to happen before calling DeviceModule::stopTransfer() to ensure the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> does not start the recovery yet. When clearing it in doPreWrite(), and setting it in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> during recovery, the recoveryLock must be held (see 4.5.2).</li>
<li>1.1.2 The ordering guarantee cannot work across DeviceModules anyway. Different devices may go offline and recover at different times. Even in case of two DeviceModules which actually refer to the same hardware device there is no synchronisation mechanism which ensures the recovering procedure is done in a defined order.</li>
<li>1.3.0 Updating the recoveryHelper first ensures that no data is lost, even if the write operation attempt is concurrent with a recovery. See 4.5.2.</li>
<li>1.3.2 Extending the duration of the lock until the decision whether to skip the transfer will prevent unncessary duplicate writes, which otherwise could occur if the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> went through the whole critical section 2.3.2 to 2.3.10 in between.</li>
<li>1.2.5 The cppext::future_queue in the TransferFuture is a notification queue and hence of the type void. So we don't have to "invent" any value. Also this injection of values is legal, since the queue is multi-producer but single-consumer. This means, potentially concurrent injection of values while the actual accessor might also write to the queue is allowed. Also, the application is the only receiver of values of this queue, so injecting values cannot disturb the backend in any way.</li>
<li>1.4.2 In A.2.2.4 it was stated that also in case AccessMode::wait_for_new_data is set blocking read transfers are frozen on the second operation. Nothing is to be implemented for this case, the freezing simply relies on having an empty queue in the accessor. Once the device sends data again, the operation is intrinsically unfrozen.</li>
<li>1.4.4 The transferCounter is already incremeted at this point. It is acceptable to freeze anyway in this case by waiting on the initialValueMutex, because the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> release the mutex after the first successful recovery and never obtains it again, and this happens before it waits for the transferCounter to become 0 in 2.3.15.</li>
<li>1.5.2 The state of <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#ad329aeca005a9b591168360ec1b068a6" title="The error flag (predicate) for the conditionVariable. ">DeviceModule::deviceHasError</a> does not matter here. The counter always MUST be decreased after a transfer (if it has been incremented in the corresponding preXxx()), whether the transfer failed or not. Note: the exact place of decrementing the counter within doPostXxx does not matter, it just has to be done after delegating to postXxx(). The other actions on doPostXxx() have no influence on the behaviour of the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>.</li>
<li>1.5.3 The RecoveryHelper::wasWritten flag is used to report loss of data. If the loss of data is already reported directly, it should not later be reported again. Hence the written flag is set even if there was a loss of data in this context.</li>
<li>1.6 Remember: exceptions from other phases are redirected to the post phase by the TransferElement base class.</li>
<li>1.6.1 No transfers will be started in any of the accessors of the device, including this one. This is important to avoid the race condition described in the comment to 4.1.3</li>
<li>1.6.3.1 The freezing is done in doPreRead(), see 1.4.</li>

<ul>
<li>2.3.6 The exact place when this is done does not matter, as long as it is done after 2.3.15 (no ongoing synchronous transfers) and before 2.3.8 (resetting deiveHasError). As soon as deviceHasError is cleared new exceptions can be reported, which would be lost if the list was cleared afterwards. Moving it as early as possible after the device has been reopenend has the (slight) advantage, that exceptions which might be reported by asynchronous transfers during the recovery are not discarded, even if the recovery itself does't catch them for some reason. Since exceptions reported by asynchronous transfers are subject to race conditions with the recovery procedure, there cannot be strict guarantees about the behaviour. The optimal place where to reset the queue (to minimise unnecessary recoveries while minimising the probability of rejecting true errors which then need to be found instead later by other transfers) might need to be found in real-life experiments later.</li>

<li>11.6 In comment to 1.g: recovery accessors are not optional at the moment.</li>
<li>11.7 In 1.c: Currently data is transported even if the "value after construction" is still in.</li>
<li>11.8 In 1.i, 6: ThreadedFanout and TriggerFanout do not use non-blocking write because it does not exist yet</li>
<li>11.9 In 1.j, 2.5.3: Not implemented like that. The first read blocks, and a special mechanism to propagate the flags is triggered only in the next module.</li>
<li>11.10 In 2.3: The device module has a special "first opening" sequence. This is not necessary any more. The "writeAfterOpen" list is obsolete. You can always use the recovery accessors.</li>
<li>11.11 In 2.3.4: Recovery accessors are always written. It is not checked whether there is valid data (not "value after construction")</li>
<li>11.12 In 2.4.1.1: Write probably re-executed after recovery. This should not happen because the recovery accessor has already done it.</li>
<li>11.13 In 2.5.3: The non-blocking read functions always block on exceptions. They should not (only if there is no initial value).</li>
<li>11.14 In 2.5.2, 5.1: writeWithoutErrorBlocking is not implemented yet</li>
<li>11.15 Asynchronous reads are not working with the current implementation, incl. readAny.</li>
<li>11.16 In 3: DeviceAccess : RegisterAccessors throw in doReadTransfer now.</li>
<li>11.17 In 4.2.1: reportException does block (should not)</li>
<li>11.18 In 4.2.2: blocking wait function does not exist (not needed in current implementation as reportException blocks)</li>
<li>11.19 In 5.2.1: Exceptions are caught in doXxxTransfer instead of doPostXxx.</li>
