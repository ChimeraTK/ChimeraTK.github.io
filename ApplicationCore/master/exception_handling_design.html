<h1><a class="anchor" id="gen_idea"></a>
General Idea</h1>
<p>Exceptions must be handled by ApplicationCore in a way that the application developer does not have to care much about it.</p>
<p>In case of a ChimeraTK::runtime_error exception the framework must catch the expection and report it to the DeviceModule. The DeviceModule handles this exception and preiodically tries to open the device. In case of several devices only the faulty device is blocked. Even if a device is faulty it should not block the server from starting.</p>
<p>If an input variable is in the error state, it sets the DataValidity flag for its DataValidityProparationExecutor (see <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>) to faulty and the flag is propogated appropriately. After the exception is cleared and operation returns without a data fault flag, set DataValidity flag to ok. Furthermore, the device must be reinitialised automatically and also recover the values of process variables as the device might have rebooted and the variables have been re-set.</p>
<p><b>1. Genesis</b></p><ul>
<li>a (removed)</li>
<li>b. An initailisation handler can be added to the DeviceModule in the user code. Initialisation handlers are callback function which will be executed when a device is opened for the first time and after a device recovers from an exception, before any process variables are written.</li>
<li>c. Initial values must be correctly propogated after a device is opened. See <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>. Especially, no read function (even readNonBlocking/readLatest) must return before an initial value has been received.</li>
<li>d. (removed)</li>
<li>e. A <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ChimeraTK::ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> is placed around all ChimeraTK::NDRegisterAccessors which connect a device to a <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ChimeraTK::ApplicationModule</a> or fanout. (*)</li>
<li>f. (removed)</li>
<li>g. By default a recovery accessor is added for each device register when it is obtianed. These recovery accessors are used to correctly set the values of variables when the device is opened for the first time and after a device is recovered from an exception. (*)</li>
<li>h. A <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ChimeraTK::ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> for an input knows its DataValidityProparationExecutor, which lives in the ApplicationModule or fanout that reads the input. Like this it can propagate the dataValidity flag. Outputs do not send DataValidity faulty in case of exceptions (see <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>).</li>
<li>i. Write should not block in case of an exception for the outputs of ThreadedFanOut / TriggerFanOut. (*)</li>
<li>j. Exception handling and invalid flag propagation has to be implemented such that it is transparent to a module whether it is directly connected to a device, or whether a fanout or another application module is in between.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. The Flow</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2.1. The application always starts with all devices as closed and intial value for deviceError.status is set to 1. The DeviceModule takes care that ExceptionHandlingDecorators do not perform any read or write operations, but block. This must happen before running any prepare() of an ApplicationModule, where the first write calls to ExceptionHandlingDecorators are done.</li>
<li>2.2 In ApplicationModule::prepare() some initial values (and constants) are written. As the ExceptionHandlingDecorator must not perform the actual write at this point, it will put the value into the dataRecoveryAccesssor and report an exception to the DeviceModule.<ul>
<li>2.2.3 Although ApplicationModule and fanout threads start after the device module threads, the application is now asyncronous and read or write operations can already take place in the main loops, even if the device is not ready yet (it might actually be broken). All read and write operations are blocked buy the exceptionHandlingDecorators at this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.3 The device module thread starts.<ul>
<li>2.3.1 The DeviceModule tries to open the device until it succeeds.(*)</li>
<li>2.3.2 Device is initailised by iterating initialisationHandlers list. If there is an exception go back to 2.3.1. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.3 The list of reported exceptions is cleared. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.4 All valid (*) recovery accessors are written. If there is an exception go back to 2.3.1. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.5 deviceError.status is set to 0.</li>
<li>2.3.6 DeviceModule allows that ExceptionHandlingDecorators execute reads and writes.</li>
<li>2.3.7 All blocked read and write operations (from 2.5.3) are notified.(*)</li>
<li>2.3.8 The DeviceModuleThread waits for the next reported exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4 Device and Application are running normally<ul>
<li>2.4.1 All blocked ExceptionHandlingDecorators continue (*)<ul>
<li>2.4.1.1 write just continues (recovery accessor has done the write)</li>
<li>2.4.1.2 read/readNonBlocking/readLatest<ul>
<li>2.4.1.2.1 tells the DataValidityPropagationExecutor that the device error has gone</li>
<li>2.4.1.2.2 (re-)tries to get the value. In case of an exception go to 2.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.2 In the ExceptionHandlingDecorator, all write calls always fill the value into the recovery accessors before trying to execute the real write. Like this, the recovery accessor always has the last value that should have been written to the device. All recovery accessors become valid over time (see comment for 2.3.4).<ul>
<li>2.4.2.1 If a write is not executed because the device is already faulty (from 2.2 or 2.6.1), the recovery accessor has to take care of this. In this case we always have to send another exception notification to the DeviceModule to make sure that the new recovery value is not missed (avoid race condition). (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.5. When a read / write operation on the device (1.e) causes a ChimeraTK::runtime_error exception, the exception is caught in the ExceptionHandlingDecorator<ul>
<li>2.5.1. If it is a read operation the DataValidityPropagationExecutor is informed that there was a device error. (*)</li>
<li>2.5.2. The error is reported to the DeviceModule</li>
<li>2.5.3. Action depending on the calling operation :<ul>
<li>write : blocks until the device is recovered.</li>
<li>read : If the accessor has aleady seen its initial value, the first "blocking" read call returns immediately (remember DataValidity is set to faulty). The ExceptionHandlingDecorator remembers that it is in an exception state. The calling module thread will continue and propagate the data invalid flag. The second call will finally block. If there has not been an initial value yet, even the first call will block until it is available.</li>
<li>readNonBlocking / readLatest: will always return with data invalid flag (unless there has not been an initial value yet).</li>
<li>writeWithoutErrorBlocking: just returns (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.6 The exception is received in the DeviceModule thread<ul>
<li>2.6.1 deviceError.status will be set to 1. From this point on, all ExceptionHandlingDecorators for this device must block all read and write operations (see also 2.2 and 2.3.6).</li>
<li>2.6.2 The thread goes back to 2.2.1 and tries to re-open the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. (*) Comments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1.e. In addition there can be recovery accesors for the same variables, which are not decorated. They are not directly seen by the ApplicationModule and the fanouts.</li>
<li>1.g. Output accessors can have the option not to have a recovery accessor. This is needed for instance for "trigger registers" which start an operation on the hardware. Also void registers don't have recovery accessors.</li>
<li>1.i. The specification for initial value propagation (<a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>) also says that writes ApplicationModules don't block before the first successful read in the main loop.</li>
<li>2.3.1 Successul opening includes that the device reports isFunctional() as true.</li>
<li>2.3.2 and 2.3.4 Exceptions for re-initialisation and recovery will be reported once, but not if it occurs again before the device has completely recovered.</li>
<li>2.3.3 ExceptionHandlingDecorators must always first write the recovery accessor, then report an exception. As the device module clears the exceptions first, then processes the accessors, it is guaranteed that no value is missed. As a side effect it can be that a pending exception triggers an unnecessary recovery loop in the device module.</li>
<li>2.3.4 If a recovery accessors has not seen an initial value yet, it will not be written (see <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>).</li>
<li>2.3.7 This is different from 2.2.6 because 2.2.6 affects accessors which want to perform a read or write, while 2.2.7 affects accessors that failed to do so and are waiting for the device to become available again. This is needed for two cases:<ul>
<li>1. A blocking write, where the recovery accessor has already done the job when the device if back to OK.</li>
<li>2. The first blocking read if the data has not seen the initial value yet, and retrieving it casued the exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.1 writeWithoutErrorBlocking is not mentioned because it never blocks. Although blocked by different mechanisms read/readNonBlocking/readLatest behave the same:<ul>
<li>read is either the second read call which is expected to deliver the next value, or any of the three are still waiting for the initial value. In any case they have to (re-)try reading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.2.1 Basically after each update of the recovery accessor there has to be a valid write, or an exception has to be reported to the DeviceModule, to make sure the value is seen by the device (unless the recovery accessor is updated before this happens).</li>
<li>2.5.1 incrementDataInvalidCounter() is called. See <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Asyncronous read</b></p><ul>
<li>The transfer future in readAsync() behaves like the normal read:<ul>
<li>The first call to hasNewData() returns true if an error occured in the read transfer. <code>wait()</code> will return immediately with DataVality::faulty.</li>
<li>The second call to hasNewData() will return false until the device has recovered and there actually is new data. <code>wait()</code> will bock until then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="exception_handling_implmentation"></a>
Implementation</h1>
<p><b>3. DeviceAccess</b></p>
<p>Requirements to the DeviceAccess interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1 Exceptions are only reported in doPostRead()/doPostWrite()<ul>
<li>As the error itself always occurs in the read/write transfer, the TransferElement base class implements a mechanism to catch it and transfer the exception message into the post-read function, where it is re-thrown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is required for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A tranfer must always be complete, i.e. preXxx and postXxx must always be called. This is for instance important in case a user buffer has been swapped out, and has to be swapped back in so the user buffer stays intact in the application. Letting the exception in doXxxTransfer through would break this. (This is DeviceAcces spec.)</li>
<li>2. The transfer groups calls doXxxTransfer itself on a potentially exchanged hardware accessing element. All code using transfer groups would have to do exception handling itself, and the individual accessors would not behave according to this (ApplicationCore excetion handling) specification when used with a transfer group. By throwing in doPostXxx the ExceptionHandlingDecorator can handle it, and it automatically works with transfer groups.</li>
<li>3. Asyncronous reads are executing the transfer in a different thread anyway, and have to delay the throwing to postRead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before throwing, each backend must make sure that the actions in doPostRead() are completed such that the user buffer of a calling accessor is intact</p><ul>
<li>postRead() and postWrite() take care that the bookkeeping of ongoing transfers is done correctly, even if the called doPostXxx actions throw.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. The DeviceModule</b></p>
<p>Interfaces</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">External interface</p>
<p class="startli">An error status and the last error message are automatically connected to the control system for each device</p><ul>
<li>/Devices/{AliasName}/message</li>
<li>/Devices/{AliasName}/status</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Implements 2.1, 2.3.5, 2.6.1</p>
</li>
<li>4.2 Internal interface to the ExceptionHandlingDecorator<ul>
<li>4.2.1 A thread safe function <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#a866cf974d4a178d389753536be5a88db" title="Use this function to report an exception. ">ChimeraTK::DeviceModule::reportException()</a> (implements 2.5.2).</li>
<li>4.2.2 A blocking way to wait for the device to become available after reporting the exception (implements 2.3.7 and 2.4.1)</li>
<li>4.2.3 A shared mutex to prevent read and write operations before the device has been initialised (implementes 1.b, 2.1, 2.3.6 and 2.6.1)</li>
<li>4.2.4 A function to add recoveryAccessors (implements 1.g)</li>
<li>4.2.5 A shared mutext to protect the covery accessors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.2.1 A user/application can also report device errors calling DeviceModue::reportException(). This allows to for instance to write a watchdog module which is monitoring a reference regsiter, and puts</li>
<li>the whole device into an exception state (incl. automatic message to the CS, propagation of the DataValidity::faulty flag and recovery).</li>
<li>4.2.2 Currently implemented as a condition variable</li>
<li>4.2.3 Read/write operations must hold a shared lock before executing the actual read/write. This is implemented in the ExceptionHandlingDecorator. As the lock is shared, parallel write operations don't block each other inside application core. While recovering, the device module will hold an exclusive lock.</li>
<li>4.2.5 As the recovery accessors are filled in the ApplicationModule threads (or fanouts), but the writing is taking place in the device module thread, the recovery accessor's user buffer must be protected with a mutex. Again, a shared mutex is used so normal write operations can run in parallel and don't interfere with each other (each one only touches its own buffer), and the write, which touches all buffers holds an exlusive lock.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>5. ExceptionHandlingDecorator</b></p>
<ul>
<li>5.1 External interface<ul>
<li>5.1.1 Provides a function that does not block writes, even if the device is not available (part of implementation of 1.i) [TBD: name of the function, maybe writeWithoutErrorBlocking() ]</li>
<li>5.1.2 There is a convenience function that allows to call a this function on any transfer element. If it is has an ExceptionHandlingDecorator, this functionis called. Otherwise the normal write() is executed, which does not block in case of connections inside of ApplicationCore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5.2 Internal interface with other parts of ApplicationCore<ul>
<li>5.2.1 Catches exception thrown in TransferElement::doPostRead()/doPostWrite() (implements 1.e)</li>
<li>5.2.2 In read operations, it informs it's associated DataValidityPropagationExecutor about device errors (implements 2.4.2.1 and 2.5.1)</li>
<li>5.2.3 Reports exceptions to the DeviceModule (implements 2.5.2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5.3 Implementation<ul>
<li>5.3.1 Writing<ul>
<li>5.3.1.1 Writes to the recovery accessor before initiating the transfer (implements 2.4.2) in doPreWrite()</li>

<p><b>6. TriggerFanout and ThreadedFanOut </b></p>
<ul>

If one of the poll-type inputs is in error state, it shall not block the other variables. To implement this, the TriggerFanout uses the non-blocking write provided by ExceptionHandlingDecorator (see 5.1.1). This is possible because TriggerFanOuts are only connected to device variables. (implements 1.i)</li>
<li>6.2 ThreadedFanOut If outputs of a ThreadedFanOut also write do devices, the writes must not block the other variables in the fanout. To implement this, the TreadedFanOut uses the non blocking write through the convenience function described in 5.1.2 (implements 1.i)</li>

<p><b>10. Recover process variables after exception.</b></p>
<p>Background.</p>
<p>After a device has failed and recovered, it might have re-booted and lost the values of the process variables that live in the server and are written to the device. Hence these values have to be re-written after the device has recovered.</p>
<p>Description.</p>
<p>Create a copy of accessor when writing the data to the device and use this to recover the values when the device is available again. Recovery accessor do not write if the register is never written before (2.5.3.5.).</p>
<p>Implementation.</p>

<li><a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ChimeraTK::ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a></li>
<li>A list of ChimeraTK::TransferElements is created as <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#accf9d83766a0503e4118aeeae0aec36e" title="List of TransferElements to be written after the device has been recovered.

">ChimeraTK::ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> is extended by adding second accessor to the same register as the target accessor it is decorating. <em> Data is copied in doPreWrite(). [TBD: Do we want this behaviour? =&gt; Yes, it has to happen before the original accessor's pre-write because this is the last occasion where the data is still guarateed to be in our user buffer. The accessor's pre-write might swap the data out, and it might never be available again (in case of write desrictively).]</em></li>
<li>As the user buffer recovery accessor is written in an AppicationModule or fanout thread, but read in the DeviceModule thread when recovering, it has to be protected by a mutex. For efficiency one single shared mutex is used. All ExceptionHandlingDecorators will accquire a shared lock, as each decorator only touches his own buffer. The DeviceModule, which writes all recovery accessors, uses the unique lock to prevent any ExceptionHandlingDecorator to modify the user buffer while doing so.</li>
